                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Meet Candy. She's not just a dog, she's a force of nature, a professional snuggler, and a certified
                    happiness expert.</p>
                <p>Candy believes that every lap is meant to be sat on (regardless of size constraints), every tear
                    deserves a thorough licking, and every moment is an opportunity for tail wags and belly rubs.</p>

                <h2>About Candy</h2>
                <p>Candy came into this world with one mission: to spread love and chaos in equal measure. With her
                    soulful eyes and that magnificent snoot, she's mastered the art of getting exactly what she
                    wants-usually treats, walks, and more treats.</p>
                <p>She's a professional napper, an amateur landscaper (your garden will never be the same), and holds a
                    black belt in the ancient art of counter surfing. Despite weighing as much as a small child, she's
                    convinced she's a lap dog and will attempt to prove this at every opportunity.</p>
                <p>Her hobbies include staring contests with squirrels, eating apples, and providing
                    emotional support whether you asked for it or not.</p>
