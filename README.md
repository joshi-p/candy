## 🌟 What is This?

**Candy's Digital Portfolio** is a personal website built as my semester's project for Web Technologies showcasing the extraordinary life, skills, and adventures of Candy - my dog.

This isn't just another pet website. It's a living, breathing gallery where:

- **Friends and family** can upload pictures they've clicked with or of Candy
- **The world** can witness the pure joy that is Candy's existence
- **Certified humans** get exclusive access to contribute to her ever-growing photo gallery

## 💡 Why Does This Exist?

### The Origin Story

This project is a drive towards increasing awareness and ensuring the well-being of entities that exist in our lives as nobodies but to them, we're everything.


### The Philosophy

In Candy's own words:
> "I don't understand conventional photo albums. They're slow, traceable, and require opposable thumbs. I prefer the digital realm - it's fast, it glows, and my humans can access it from anywhere."
